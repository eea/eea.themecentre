Theme Tagging
=============

An object is taggable only if it provides IThemeTaggable.

  >>> from eea.themecentre.interfaces import IThemeTagging, IThemeTaggable
  >>> taggable = IThemeTagging(folder)

Because the folder object is new it shouldn't have any tags.

  >>> taggable.tags
  []

Let's add a few tags.

  >>> taggable.tags  = ['air', 'climate']

Let's see what tags there are.

  >>> taggable.tags
  ['air', 'climate']

Theme tags can be marked as deprecated in the themes vocabulary.
Climate change is marked as deprecated in the test set up so then
we only have air left.

  >>> taggable.nondeprecated_tags
  ['air']
