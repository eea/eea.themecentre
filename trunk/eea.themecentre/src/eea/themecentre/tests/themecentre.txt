A folder can be promoted to a Theme Centre by calling a view.

  >>> from Products.ATContentTypes.content.folder import ATFolder
  >>> from eea.themecentre.browser.themecentre import PromoteThemeCentre

  >>> folder = self.portal.to_be_promoted
  >>> view = PromoteThemeCentre(folder, self.portal.REQUEST)
  >>> view()
  '...'

When a folder is promoted to a Theme Centre a news folder should be
created. Let's see if that worked.

  >>> newsobj = getattr(folder, 'news', None)
  >>> newsobj is not None
  True
