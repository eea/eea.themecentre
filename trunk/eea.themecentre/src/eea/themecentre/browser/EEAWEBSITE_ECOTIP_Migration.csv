Keep on the move! #Instead of taking the car: walk, cycle, take the bus or use the underground. You will not only keep fit but also help reduce traffic, air pollution, noise and accidents.#air# http://www.eco-label.com/
Got an errand to run? #Cars often pollute more on short trips when the motor is cold, so try to walk or cycle instead. #air#
Inform yourself about the quality of air in your town. #Many meteorological websites provide such information. To find out the level of ozone pollution across Europe, go to EEA's Live Ozone Map. #air#http://www.eea.europa.eu/maps/ozone/welcome
Don’t skip regular check-ups of your car. #Inspect your car regularly for the emissions it generates. Catalytic converters need regular maintenance.#air#
Going to work? #Consider carpooling or using public transport rather than your own car. If driving, ask around the office which of your colleagues lives near you and whether you can share lifts. #air#
Think twice before buying a new car. #It might be more efficient to use alternatives for transport rather than keeping a car only for weekend trips.#air#
Bicycles produce neither greenhouse gases nor pollution#and are therefore the least polluting mode of transport.#air#
Use bicycle couriers! #If you run a business and need to deliver mail and parcels regularly around town, use a bicycle courier service if one is available. Bicycles bypass traffic; are quick; and you will contribute to the improvement of urban air quality in your area.#air#
Did you know that you can reduce air pollution by recycling your waste? #By recycling glass, paper, batteries, engine oil and aluminium cans, these materials can be re-used, and you will reduce the volume of waste incinerated by up to 70%.#air#
On very hot days use public transport rather than your car. #Car exhaust emissions react with sunlight and heat to cause polluting gases such as tropospheric ozone. This is the main ingredient of poor air quality and photo-chemical smog, which can cause breathing difficulties. To find out the level of ozone pollution across Europe, go to EEA's Live Ozone Map. #air#http://www.eea.europa.eu/maps/ozone/welcome
Think first before buying a Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV). #In addition to being very expensive to run, SUVs are very fuel inefficient. They emit twice as much carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen dioxide as an average car. These chemicals contribute to air pollution as well as global warming!     #air,climate#
Fresh water is scarce! #Some 97.5% of water on the Earth is salt water, leaving only 2.5% as fresh water. Of this over two thirds is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The remaining unfrozen fresh water is found mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction present in rivers, lakes or in the air. Water is a precious resource, use it responsibly and don’t waste it! #water #
Turn off the tap!#Avoid wasting water while brushing your teeth or shaving, and save up to 10 litres of water each time. Use a mug of water and turn the tap off so you only use what you need.#water #
Wash your fruits and vegetables in a bowl of water rather than under a running tap. #You will save water and will do so further by watering your houseplants with the remaining water.#water, households#
A dripping tap can waste as much as one litre of water per hour. #In one week, that is enough to fill a bathtub. Drinking water is precious. Save it! #water #
Install a water meter to keep track of your water consumption. #Households with meters tend to be more careful with their water-use and also end up saving money as well. #water,households#
Thirsty?#Fill a jug with tap water and store it in your fridge rather than waiting for the tap to run cold each time you want a glass of cold water. #water,households#
Why waste? #Boil only as much water as you need for your cup of coffee or tea. #water,households#
Take a quick shower instead of a bath.#Showers require as little as a third of the water! However, this is true as long as you keep them under five minutes long. So be quick and use a shower timer to keep track of time next time you hop in!#water,households#
Invest in low-flow showerheads to decrease your consumption of water. #They produce a finer spray and increase the flow of the water while using less of it. #water,households#
Reduce your domestic consumption of water. #By having aerators and water flow restrictors fitted on your taps, the flow of water will feel stronger, but will consist of less water and more air. Aerated taps can reduce the water flow by 30-40 %.#water,households#
Drop in a hippo! #Decrease your toilet’s water-use by dropping a hippo or other displacement device into the cistern. If you’re planning on buying a new toilet, consider a water efficient one with a dual flush. #water,households#
A leaking toilet could waste as much as 200 litres of water per day. #This is equivalent to flushing your toilet 50 times. Check your toilet for a possible leak.#water,households#
Only run the dishwasher when it's completely full. #In this way, you actually use less water than if you wash the dishes by hand. #water,households#
Go for the eco-label! #When shopping for a new washing machine, look for an energy-efficient model that uses the least amount of water. To find out more, visit the Eco-Label web-site that lists energy-efficient appliances: #water,households#http://www.eco-label.com/
Sounds like common sense, but #a sure way to save water when doing the laundry is to do less of it! Before starting your washing machine, wait for a full load and check your clothes if they really are dirty; one wear does not always qualify them for a wash.#water,households#
Don't flush#cotton-balls, cotton-swabs and make-up tissues down the toilet. Instead dispose of them in the bin where they belong. #water#
Water your garden in the late evening or early morning. #During those cooler hours, less water is lost through evaporation and as a result plants will absorb more of it. #water,households#
The water hose in your garden can release as much as 18 litres of water a minute. #Use a traditional watering can instead and significantly reduce the water wasted. Alternatively, you can fit the hose with a trigger gun to control the water-flow.#water#
Soak, don’t sprinkle! #When gardening, soak the roots of your plants twice a week instead of sprinkling water on them each day. This way much more water is absorbed instead of evaporating. #water#
If you let your lawn grow longer, it will require less water. #Taller grass encourages deeper roots and shades the soil to reduce moisture loss.#water#
Collect rainwater #for watering your garden instead of using precious drinking water from the tap. Also, remember to check the weather forecast before watering the garden; it may be about to rain.#water#
Hand-wash your car with a bucket, sponge and soap. #You’ll use up only a few litres of water compared to a commercial car wash which can use from 32 to 150 litres each time. You can achieve the same result, but with far less water.#water#
Mulch your plants – indoors and outdoors.#It will keep weeds away; protect the plants by keeping the soil cool; decrease evaporation and reduce soil compaction. Be creative and use materials like: pebbles, bark chippings, gravel, cocoa shells, decorative pine cones, marbles, broken crockery, grass clippings or leaf mould. But avoid mulching too close to the stems to avoid the plant rotting in winter. #water#
If you have a garden, creating a pond is a great way to boost biodiversity.#Frogs, water beetles, pond snails, and sometimes dragonflies and damselflies will use ponds. However, remember: avoid tadpole-eating goldfish! #biodiversity#
Minimise your use of weed killers and insecticides. #These can kill many useful creatures and plants you didn't intend to get rid of, especially if they seep into ponds and streams. There are many wildlife-friendly alternatives.#biodiversity#
Pesticides contain dangerous and harmful toxic chemicals that are damaging human health. #Residues from garden pesticides and insecticides can linger in the home. Contact your local authorities to find out where to safely and properly dispose of them. #biodiversity, chemicals#
Kill weeds with hot boiling water or simply burn them. #Weeds that have had boiling water poured over them turn brown within a few hours and die. There is no toxic residue and the area is immediately safe for children to play.#biodiversity#
Home gardens can add immensely to the biodiversity of cities and towns. #They provide cover, feeding and commuting routes for wildlife including hedgehogs, badgers, birds and butterflies. If you have a garden, increase its value by planting berry-bearing trees and flowering plants. Rowan, bird cherry and dandelion, among others, can serve as food and shelter to a wide range of invertebrates.#biodiversity#
Biodiversity: Set a good example! #Encourage others in your community to create biodiversity ‘hot spots’. How? A row of gardens could create a biodiversity corridor linking wildlife to a local park or green space.#biodiversity#
Keep your dog on a lead if it is likely to run off and disturb wildlife. #In particular, be careful of nesting birds in early spring and early summer, and roosting or feeding birds in winter. If you have a dog, keep this in mind when you're taking it for a walk!#biodiversity#
Dispose, don’t pour! #Anything you pour down your drain, sink or toilet can eventually end up in our rivers or sea! Never dispose of liquids such as oils, grease, or hazardous liquids – like paint thinners or unused paint – by pouring them down the drain. Instead, collect them in one box and dispose with the rest of your waste. Keep them all in their individual packaging, to avoid possible chemical reactions. This will also make it easier for them to be identified during waste collection. If applicable, take them to your community collection point. #biodiversity, chemicals #
Don't buy timber from illegal trade! #Illegal trade in tropical timber contributes to forest destruction. Many hardware suppliers are now selling timber that has been certified as legal and sustainable. Next time you shop for wood-products, check for labels such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). #biodiversity#
When travelling to exotic places, choose your souvenirs carefully. #Trade in items such as woodcarvings, red coral or ornaments with fur or feathers, is often regulated and permits are required to bring them home. Check the rules, as there are strict laws governing exports of wildlife and you could risk having your souvenir confiscated. #biodiversity#
Be creative and design a wildlife area in your garden! #In addition to creating a natural haven for you and your family, it will attract butterflies and also provide cover for frogs, mammals and insects. #biodiversity#
Support your national parks! #Visit nature reserves and parks to show support for their creation, preservation and even their expansion. Remember to leave these areas as you found them.#biodiversity#
Conserve water by letting your lawn grow longer. #Let the grass grow higher and thus encourage root growth. It will also allow the grass to self-seed. If you mow a path in the middle, it will show that it is indeed meant to be that way as opposed to being neglected. #biodiversity#
A rotting log is a mini nature reserve in its own right! #By removing dead or dying trees from woodland, a section of the natural nutrient-cycle can be lost. A lack of dead wood reduces species diversity by about 20 %. Avoid removing dead wood from your property. You could be doing away with thousands of invertebrate species and fungi. #biodiversity#
Buy a ’recyclable’ Christmas tree! #If you buy a Christmas tree, buy one with roots so that you can keep it watered. When Christmas is over you can plant it in the garden. If you buy a cut tree, recycle it by having it collected by your local authorities. #biodiversity#
To prevent soil erosion, plant vegetation with complementary root systems. #Some examples include lavender that have deep roots, which form a dense network that stabilises the soil. #biodiversity#
From a distance… #Appreciate wildlife, but be sure to watch wild animals from a distance and avoid feeding them. Remember, the scent you leave when you touch a nest or a lair may scare the parents off for good. Instead of touching, try to find out more about them and maybe even discover how you can contribute to their protection. #biodiversity#
Take part in the next census of birds in your country. #In addition to making a valuable contribution to the national bird survey, you can learn how to recognise wrens, robins and will also spend a day outdoors. #biodiversity#
When on a hiking trip do not leave anything behind, especially litter. #If you come across anything that others have left behind, act responsibly and pick it up. #biodiversity#
Where you can, choose organically farmed fish such as sea bass, salmon and trout. #Non-organic fish uses large quantities of chemicals and antibiotics which can affect other animals in the food chain. It is also worth bearing in mind that to produce a 3 kg farmed salmon, 15 kg of fish are caught in the wild to provide its meal and oil. #biodiversity#
Welcome a newborn in your family by planting a tree. #In addition to creating a happy memory, this tree will give you shade, create a small ecosystem and produce oxygen. #biodiversity#

If on holidays by a tropical lagoon or coral reef, avoid touching or stepping on corals. #When diving, do not break off a branch of coral to take home as a souvenir. Coral reefs are precious and they are disappearing#biodiversity#
Create a small ecosystem #in your garden or park by piling up some logs in a secluded corner. These will provide shelter for hedgehogs, frogs and toads. If you half-bury the bottom logs in the soil, you will also encourage stag beetles as they are fond of rotten wood. A pile of stones will also provide shelter to a range of insects and spiders. #biodiversity#
Compost! #Start a composting scheme by inviting your neighbours and even your local school to compost organic waste. It is a natural fertiliser and it can increase the soil's ability to retain water and air. #biodiversity#
Did you know? #Certain non-recyclable paper products (such as tissues, napkins, and egg cartons) can be added to your compost. Their fibres will aerate the compost and help the organisms that encourage decomposition. #biodiversity#
Choose your pet carefully and think before buying an exotic animal#Reptiles, birds and fish are often taken from their natural habitats. The black market for exotic pets has devastated entire populations of species, and it is still the fastest growing sector in the pet market. #biodiversity#
If you're up for an unusual holiday, why not volunteer for nature conservation? #Many travel companies offer such trips. It will give you the opportunity to work with passionate people and to do something positive in support of an environmental cause. #biodiversity#
Grow your own vegetable garden or just a few in window boxes.#You'll enjoy tasty and fresh vegetables free of pesticides.  #biodiversity#
Help to clean up your surroundings. #Each year on World Environment Day, schools and environmental organisations worldwide organise clean up operations. Join one! In addition to enriching the landscape of your neighbourhood, you will learn more about the animals and plants that live nearby. #biodiversity#
Looking to add new plants to your garden?#Be careful when buying for your garden. People are one of the main introducers of invasive species, especially flora. Many of the invasive species have been introduced for ornamental purposes. Do put an extra effort in finding out whether the plant you want is native to your environment. #biodiversity#
Buy locally-produced fresh produce #either directly from the farmer or at a local fruit and vegetable market. Seasonal food is good for you and the environment. Cutting the number of kilometres your food has travelled and avoiding packaging reduces pollution and waste. #households#
Where possible, switch to organic food! #Organic food production uses no synthetic pesticides, produces slightly less greenhouse gases and usually leaves more room for biodiversity in agricultural areas.   #households#
Eat meat in moderation!#If you're a meat eater, consider reducing your meat consumption and going for quality rather than quantity. Production of meat consumes enormous amounts of energy, not only for the growth and transport of animal feed, but also for the heating, air conditioning, and lighting of the immense animal farms. Changing to a diet with less meat helps the environment, but is also good for your health. It is best to buy meat from local producers and buy organic too. #households#
Disposable napkins are often given out for free but this is no reason to waste them. #Instead of taking a handful, one or two should be more than enough. Be reasonable and trees will thank you for it! #households#
Eat fruit and vegetables that are in season. #They taste better, are healthier for you, and their cultivation has less impact on the environment. #households#
Enjoy beef but eat in moderation. #Beef production accounts for around three times more greenhouse gas emissions than the production of poultry or pork. #households#
Consider your dairy consumption.#The production of butter, cheese and other dairy products with high fat content accounts for high greenhouse gas emissions as well as for eutrophication of groundwater, rivers and seas. Remember: Globally, around 70 % of all agricultural land is used for livestock production. #households#
Don't waste food. #Buy only the amounts you really need, and make use of leftovers. This way you can reduce waste and also prevent emissions from additional production of food.#households#
Invest in a lunch box.#If needed use cling film and paper instead of aluminium foil when you prepare your lunch. Reducing the amount of materials you use will reduce the amount of rubbish you throw away and this is good news for the environment! #households#
Don't start a washing machine unless it is fully loaded with laundry or dishes.#Its energy and water consumption will be the same whether it's full or empty so you might as well optimise its cycle. #households#
Let your hot food cool down before putting it in the refrigerator# and defrost food from the freezer in the fridge. Both will save you money on your energy bill. Also, remember to keep the fridge door open for only as long as you need it. #households#
Let the light shine in!#Decrease your CO2 emissions and keep your electricity bills low by making the most of natural light. Think about choosing pale-coloured walls, ceilings and floors, as well as mirrors, to reflect the daylight. #households#
How often do you go through your family albums?#Instead of printing all your digital photographs, archive them on your computer and share them with your loved ones via email.#households#
Take a shower rather than a bath!#This way you can cut your water consumption by a third! Pause the water flow when soaping and avoid long showers. A shower uses about 30 to 80 litres, while a bath uses 150 to 200 litres of precious water. Install low-flow shower heads and think before buying a power shower. #households#
Is junk and marketing mail being delivered to your home?#Removing your name from the mailing list can be as easy as sending a letter, postcard, email or ticking a box on a form. This can save many trees and a lot of water each year. You can also add a sign on your mailbox: ‘No advertisements please’. #households#
Got lime scale to remove?#Instead of chemical products, try using vinegar to remove lime scale from tiles, taps, kettles and irons.  #households#
Buy eco-friendly dishwashing detergent.# It is largely biodegradable, less polluting to aquatic habitats and just as effective a cleaning agent as less environmentally friendly options. Look for eco-friendly dishwashing detergents, such as those labelled with the European flower eco-label (see www.eco-label.com to find one in your country).#households#
Say no to paper towels! #A mop or sponge will do an even better job at cleaning up a spill so why waste paper? Reduce your waste and you'll help trees. #households#
Planning to renovate your house or apartment?#Look for ways to reduce the energy consumption for heating and cooling, for example by sealing windows and doors, insulation or changing the windows. Today it is possible to build ‘carbon neutral’ houses. #households#
Pay your bills online!#Eliminate your paper trail as well as the energy used to transport paper bills.#households#
Say no to plastic or paper bags!#The plastic bags you use but for a few minutes can last for as long as 15 to 1,000 years in the environment. Don't get a new plastic bag each time you go shopping. Get a funky re-useable or cotton bag instead and say 'no thanks' to plastic or paper bags. #households#
Favour toxic-free electronics! #Many electronic goods contain hazardous toxic chemicals that are harmful to the environment once discarded. Before buying a new electronic device, find out what companies offer toxic-free products by visiting the following EU website: #households#http://www.eco-label.com 
In the market for a new printer?#When buying a new printer consider one that allows ink cartridges to be refilled with rechargeable kits. It is very cost effective and environmentally friendly. If this is not applicable to your printer remember to recycle your used cartridges by returning them to the shop where you buy the new ones. #households#
Invest in rechargeable batteries instead of buying disposable ones. #You will save money in the long term. You can also buy solar powered rechargers if you want to reduce your environmental impact even further. #households#
Say no to disposable products! #We're using an increasing number of one-use products such as plastic razors, cups, paper towels, wipes, nappies, plastic bags, paper napkins and even disposable cameras to name a few. Not only do they usually cost more in the long-run, they involve the consumption of more resources and energy than their reusable alternatives. #households#
When shopping for new electronics, favour products with low energy use.#You can use energy labels (A++, A+, A, B) for guidance, and for office electronics the Energy Star label. In the long-run, they will save you money on your electricity bill. To find out what products are included, go to EU's website: www.eu-energystar.org.   #households#
Close the loop! #Purchase products made from recycled materials. Who else should buy all the products made from the stuff you throw into the recycling bins?   #households#
When preparing a good meal, buy Fairtrade!#Fairtrade ensures Southern producers get their fair share. There are also many products which are certified Fairtrade and organic at the same time. #households#
Don't forget about your local shops.#New supermarkets in the area can reduce business for smaller shops. Pollution and congestion would be significantly less if consumers frequented their local shops, rather than travelling long distances to out-of-town shopping centres. #households#
Buy lasting potted flowers!#When the urge to give flowers takes you, choose a potted plant from a local supplier. A lot of exotic flowers are grown in greenhouses great distances away. Aside from the issue of transport, there can be high social and environmental costs. For example, in Colombia, the flower industry uses enormous quantities of polluting pesticides, and in Kenya, horticulture requires a lot of water which reduces local water resources. As an alternative ask your flower shop for Fairtrade or organically produced flowers.  #households#
Buy your music as electronic files online and pollute less! #You will save a trip to the music store as well as reducing the use of CDs, plastic boxes, packaging and transportation, not to mention some money.#households#
Buy what you need and not what you want!#If everyone on earth lived a European lifestyle, we would need three planets to supply all the resources. Do not fall into the trap of consumerism and make a shopping list of items you need rather than picking up unnecessary items that you think you need. This will also save you money.  #households#
Upgrade your computer! #The EEA has upgraded their office PCs with additional memory space. This way, the life-time of the computers was extended by another two years and avoided a lot of electronic waste.#households#
Dispose medical waste properly!#Landfills or sewage systems are not the place for old medication. Instead, dispose them at designated disposal stations or take them back to your pharmacist.#households,human#
Don't throw away your printer cartridges.#Instead, recycle them! Most office supply stores make it possible to turn in your old, used cartridges when buying new ones. #households#
Got bulky waste to dispose of?#When you'd like to get rid of large waste items, take it to a drop-off centre or contact a special company to come and pick it up. The professionals will segregate and possibly recycle your waste. Some products, including refrigerators and other electric appliances, have to be recycled properly not to pollute the environment. You can also use the internet or newspapers to sell goods which still have some value.  #households, waste #
Don’t litter! #Avoid disposing any waste on the streets, in nature, and especially not in the gutter. This rubbish can end up in the water treatment system and overcharge the decontamination process. Take advantage of city waste baskets. They are everywhere and that's what they are for. #households#
Need new glasses? #Around 10 million pairs of usable spectacles are discarded each year in Europe and North America. These can be used to help people in the developing world to afford glasses. Most opticians now act as collection points for old glasses, so drop yours off and give them a new lease on life. #households#
When the time comes to change your car battery, recycle your old one. #Check with your local authorities for their advice as they might recommend that you take it to a special disposal site, or to a garage which collects them for recycling and proper disposal. #households#
Dispose of toxic materials properly! #The best way to dispose of paint is to deliver it to your local specialist waste recycling centre. If you do not have access to one of these, let the paint dry fully, adding sawdust or cat litter as needed, before putting it in the dustbin. Don't throw it down the drain, because it is toxic and it interferes with the processes of water treatment plants. #households,chemicals#
Dripping oil?#Did you know that most of oil pollution in our oceans is the result of human activity on land and not tanker spills? If you notice oil leaking from your car, fix it right away! Never dispose of used oil into a storm drain. #households,waste #
Donate your old clothes to charities or collection programs.#Your old wardrobe will be given a second life as either second-hand clothes or shredded and recycled as raw material for textiles and packaging. This will save precious energy and our scarce natural resources. #households#
Think twice before buying more toys for your children.#Many of them are used only very shortly and then thrown away. Go for high-quality, long-lasting toys that can be used by several generations of children. Selling old toys on a flea market can give your toys a second life and can be much fun for you and the kids. #households#
Dispose with care! #Take your electronic waste to a local collection point or give it back to the retailer so that it can be treated or recycled properly. Electronic and electric appliances contain many toxic substances. Since mid 2005, all European Member States are obliged to set up take-back systems for this waste.#households,chemicals#
Going on a trip?#If getting there by car, instead of by train or bus, be generous and share the space. By taking other people who might have made their journey in a separate car, you're putting one less car on the road.  #transport#
Get in shape and be friendly to the environment all at once! #Journeys of less than 3 km may take less time if you walk, use a bike or even take the bus. If taking your kids along, try using a skateboard, skipping rope, rollerblades or buggy boards! Remember how much fun it was when you were a kid. #transport#
Walk or cycle: Set a good example! #Walk or cycle to your work as much as it is possible and you’ll set your kids a good example. Encourage them to walk, cycle or take the bus when going to and from school each day! Both their health and the environment will benefit. #transport#
Car pool!#If you live far away from school, instead of driving your kids to and from school each day, start a car pooling initiative with the other parents and share the responsibility. It will save you time, petrol and help the environment.   #transport#
Keep your tyres properly inflated. #This will reduce wear and tear on them and increase their longevity, thereby saving money. It also saves precious raw material: it takes 27 litres of crude oil to produce a new tire. Under-inflated tyres also increase fuel consumption by up to 10%. Check your tyres at least once a month. It takes but a few minutes. #transport#
Share your automobile! #If you have to use a car to get to work, sign up to a car sharing scheme. #transport#
Slow down!# When driving your car, drive steadily and anticipate what is coming up. Avoid rapid accelerations and breaking as much as possible. This will decrease your car’s fuel consumption. #transport#
Have your oil changed by a professional.#Take your car to a garage to have the oil changed. They will collect the used oil and recycle it. #transport#
When travelling, choose eco tourism. #Developing countries often gain little financial benefit from the influx of visitors to their shores. Only around 30 % of the money spent by tourists on their holiday remains in the host country. Eco tourism is promoted in some countries. For sustainable destinations, explore EU’s catalogue at www.eco-label.com or the National Geographic's portal at www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/sustainable. #households#http://www.eco-label.com                    http://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/sustainable/ 
If travelling by plane, off-set your CO2 emissions.# Many airlines and travel agencies offer carbon-credit schemes in their services.   #climate change#
Innovate! #Encourage your workplace to develop a sustainable transport policy for business trips. You can buy carbon credits to off-set flights, minimise physical meetings involving travel by using conference or video-calls or take a sleeper train instead of flying.#transport, climate change #
Sign your emails with style. #Adding a short sentence ‘Be kind to our planet and print this email only when necessary.’ will spread the word and help save our trees! ##
Print less! #At the office, encourage your colleagues to re-use the other side of paper and print less by archiving their emails and attachments. You can also try and create paperless habits. Some studies show that office paper consumption is rising by 20 % per year and web-based technology is actually increasing the printing of documents. On average each worker uses about 50 sheets of A4 per day. Must you print? #households#
Save paper by setting your printer to print double sided by default. #You can also print two pages per page if it remains legible. The EEA has introduced double-side default printing, which reduced the Agency’s paper consumption by around 17 % from 2004 to 2005. #households#
Re-use paper!#Instead of using a fresh piece of paper for rough work, turn over a used copy and write on the other side. Use products made of recycled paper. Remember! Every ton of recycled paper saves 17 trees compared to paper made from virgin materials. #households#
Get a mug!#Invest in your own office coffee mug instead of using disposable plastic or paper cups. If you drink two coffees a day, you would be saving approximately 400 plastic cups in one year.#households#
Buy in bulk! #At your workplace, suggest that individual packets of coffee, sugar, cream and tea be replaced by large containers for everyone's use. It will be cheaper and will reduce.#households#
Use a toy library and if there isn't one in your neighbourhood, start one!#Instead of buying new toys, set up a toy library with your friends and exchange them. The variety of toys will entertain the kids and they will be used by more than one child thus reducing your impact on the environment.#households#
Human activity generates six gigatonnes of carbon dioxide per year, #while the Earth can recycle only three gigatonnes.  The rest accumulates each year in the atmosphere, thus reinforcing the greenhouse effect. Remember to save energy!#climate#
Turn the heat down!#Comfortable room temperature is 19 °C, but 15 °C is just perfect for bedrooms, as it can help you sleep better. Remember to turn the heating off if you're leaving for the holidays!#climate#
To save on your domestic energy consumption, #make your radiators more efficient by placing reflective panels or sheets of aluminum foil behind them as this will bounce the heat back into the room.#climate#
Do not position your fridge or freezer near a heat source, #such as a stove or radiator, or even a south-facing window, as it will lead to increased electricity consumption.#climate#
If you own an old refrigerator and freezer, #defrost them at least every six months. Even better –  replace them with new models, which have automatic defrost cycles and are generally up to twice more energy-efficient.#climate#
Fill up that freezer! #Help it consume less energy by keeping it full.  It requires less energy to cool a full freezer than an empty one. Should you not have filled it, add some plastic bottles filled with water or even old newspapers – until you need the space!#climate#
Clean the dusty coils behind your refrigerator #to help disperse the heat to increase the energy efficiency of the refrigerator.  Dusty coils can waste as much as 30 % extra electricity!#climate#
The recommended temperature for a refrigerator is between 1 – 4 °C#and for the freezer it should be set at -18 °C. Each degree below these temperatures makes no difference as to how well the food is preserved, but it does increase energy consumption by approximately five per cent.  Place a thermometer in the refrigerator and the freezer to check the temperature!#climate#
Defrost your food by taking it out of the freezer the night before#and placing it in the refrigerator or simply leaving it out on the counter. Avoid defrosting in the microwave and adding to your electricity bill!#climate#
Turn down your hot water thermostat #– it doesn't need to be set higher than 60 ºC. The same goes for the boiler of your central heating. Remember, 70 % of the energy used by households in the EU is spent on heating homes and another 14 % – on heating water.#climate#
Don't forget to switch off the lights. #Switching off five lights in hallways and rooms in your house – when you don't need them – can save around EUR 60 a year! This prevents the release of approximately 400 kg of CO2 gas in one year.#climate#
Switch the lights off before going on holiday. #To save electricity, before you leave don’t forget to unplug as many appliances as is possible. If the appliances are still plugged in, they continue to use up energy. even if you switch them off.#climate#
Turn off your computer during your absence from the office #for long meetings or lunch hours.  You can thus save up to 20 % of your daily electric consumption. Even if it is not you who is paying the electricity bill, think of the environment.  #climate#
Plug the electronics in your living-room #(TV, DVD player, stereo system) into a single multi-socket electrical bar.  When not in use, simply switch off the bar and save on the electrical consumption by as much as 10 % (approximately 200 000 W a year). Appliances left on standby still use quite a lot of electricity. #climate#
Don't forget to unplug your battery chargers #after you've finished charging your mobile phone or laptop. If left plugged in, they continue to consume energy.#climate#
Try to cool off without resorting to air conditioning. #The use of A/C can increase your electricity bill by 33 %. A fan requires one tenth of the energy used by an A/C system; sunshades, blinds, shutters and the cool of the night use no energy at all.#climate#
If you can, change your electricity supplier,#switch over to the one that offers part of your energy supply from renewable sources. It will send the right message to energy companies.#climate#
Don't use the pre-wash cycle on your washing machine. #Modern washing machines allow you to bypass this cycle, saving 15 % of the energy that would otherwise be used.#climate#
Bake in one go! #When baking a quiche, why not profit from an already heated oven and place your apple pie in it as well? You will save 50 % on your gas or electricity consumption!#climate#
Switch the stove or oven off a few minutes# before your food is ready and make use of the residual heat to finish cooking.#climate#
To save on energy when cooking,# cut up your veggies into small pieces to reduce the cooking time. When boiling or steaming vegetables, boil the water in the kettle first – rather than on the hob, and use only as much water as is necessary.#climate#
Iron your clothes in one batch, #rather than one item at a time. You will save the energy required to heat up the iron each time you want to use it.#climate#
Use a thermos flask to save energy. #When you boil water for a hot drink, try to boil only what you need, or pour the surplus into a thermos flask to keep the water hot for your next cup!#climate#
Put a lid on your pots when cooking. #You can save up to a quarter of the energy needed for preparing the dish. Pressure cookers and steamers are even better: they can save around 70 %! #climate#
Have your water boiler inspected once a year# – to verify whether it isn't poisoning the air in your home or consuming too much energy. Have it replaced once every 15 years – to benefit from the technological advances that render new boilers more energy-efficient.#climate#
Switch to LED flashlights. #With a lifespan of almost 100 000 hours, this lamp will serve you for dozens of years without producing any waste or pollution!#climate#
In the office, switch from the old computer monitor to #a more energy-efficient LCD screen. If you're using your screen up to eight hours a day, you can save up to 100 000 W in one year. #climate#
Our waste can produce lighting, #electricity, heat and even jobs!  Remember to recycle what you no longer need.#climate#
Get on the move and cycle, walk or use public transport! #You'll improve your health and lessen your impact on the environment. Remember that for each litre of fuel burnt in a car engine, more than 2.5 kg of CO2 is released into the atmosphere.#climate#
Going on a trip? Choose wisely. #To travel over an 800 km distance, a car will generate 178 kg of CO2, a plane – 98 kg and a train – 3 kg.  #climate#
Lonely drive to work? #Car-pooling with your colleagues will lessen your impact on the environment, save you money and let you travel in the company of others.  Ask which of your colleagues live nearby and take turns driving to work.#climate#
Buying a new car?#Why not buy one of the new generation vehicles?  A hybrid car consumes between 20 % and 30 % less fuel and generates far less CO2 than a classical vehicle. So why not pollute less and save money – all at once?#climate#
During cold winter days, don’t warm up your car's engine while idle.#It's safe to start the journey with a cold engine, and you will save on fuel.#climate#
Off for the weekend with the family? #To avoid traffic jams and the related stress, not to mention polluting, why not consider other transportation alternatives?  After all, trains are more comfortable! #climate#
Travel responsibly! # Fly only for distances greater than 700 km. Otherwise take the train. A transatlantic flight produces almost half as much CO2 as an average person produces over a period of one year while meeting all his or her other needs, such as lighting, heating and car travel!  #climate#
Yet another flight for a business meeting? #Develop a habit of considering telephone or video-conferencing first! #climate#
